# Cx Transpiler for C
Cx is an Object Oriented Transpiler for C with sophisticated template meta-programming capabilities and direct support for C Python.

# It's C
Cx is not a compiler, it is a source(Cx) to source(C); Cx requires a C compiler.

# Why?
Because the C compiler needs for nothing and no one.

# Okay... but a transpiler isn't better then a compiler 
Well yeah, the C compiler is perfect...

# But C++
Is a compiler, and requires every platform to write and maintain a compiler.

# You must be mistaken
Noted ;)
